### Wrangling and cleansing of sales and workload data

Data in real use cases are often delivered in an Excel-/CSV-based form that cannot be further processed directly. For this reason, an analysis case is shown here, simulating reality in which an Excel table has to be read in and preprocessed. This is followed by some visualizations and a simple regression.

### Relevance of NFL game statistics

Nowadays, sports events live above all from their media coverage, which includes cheering up winners and writing down losers. Statistics are used to underpin the own argumentation in this reports. But is there any cherry picking here? Are only those statistics used that make the report/commentary look completely logical? In order to give an initial assessment of the relevance of typically used statistics of NFL games, a simple but easily understandable machine learning approach is presented. This reveal statistics which might be used as a solid basis for argumentation.

### Data science career reflection based on CRISP-DM process model

How can I share my own professional experience with Master's students in business analytics and data science? Encourage them to self-reflect? I asked myself this question recently when I was invited to give a guest lecture at a university of applied sciences. My approach is to adapt the CRISP-DM process model which is familiar to many students and practitioners in the field of data science.
